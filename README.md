# Censored Sampling for Topology Design: Guiding Diffusion with Human Preferences

**Enhance TopoDiff sampling with simple human feedback.**

* **BC & FM classifiers**: Train minimal binary models for boundary and floating defects
* **Inference guidance**: Apply reward gradients to pretrained TopoDiff (no retraining)

This project builds upon the following repositories:

* [diffusion-human-feedback](https://github.com/tetrzim/diffusion-human-feedback) by tetrzim
* [TopoDiff](https://github.com/francoismaze/topodiff) by francoismaze
